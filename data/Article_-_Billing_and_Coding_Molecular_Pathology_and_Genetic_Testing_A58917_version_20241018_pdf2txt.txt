Article Guidance
Article Text
This Billing and Coding Article provides billing and coding guidance for molecular
pathology services, genomic sequencing procedures and other multianalyte assays,
multianalyte assays with algorithmic analyses, and applicable proprietary laboratory
analyses codes and Tier 1 and Tier 2 molecular pathology procedures. Consistent with
CFR, Title 42, Section 414.502, advanced diagnostic laboratory tests must provide new
clinical diagnostic information that cannot be obtained from any other test or combination
of tests.
This instruction focuses on coding and billing for molecular pathology diagnostics and
genetic testing. Nothing stated in this instruction implies or infers coverage.
Molecular diagnostic testing and laboratory developed testing are rapidly evolving areas
and thus present billing and coding challenges. Due to the rapid changes in this ﬁeld, the
CMS Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule pricing methodology does not account for the
unique characteristics of these tests. These challenges have led to services being
Article - Billing and Coding: Molecular Pathology and Geneti...
https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/artic...
6 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
incorrectly coded and improperly billed. It is the MAC’s responsibility to pay for services
that are reasonable and necessary and coded correctly. The intent of this billing and
coding article is to provide guidance for accurate coding and proper submission of claims.
Prior to January 1, 2013, each step of the process of a molecular diagnostic test was
billed utilizing a separate CPT code to describe that process. Such billing was termed
“stacking” with each step of a molecular diagnostic test utilizing a different CPT code to
create a “Stack”. The updates to CPT after January 1, 2013, were to create a more
granular, analyte and/or gene speciﬁc coding system for these services and to eliminate,
or greatly reduce, the “stacking” of codes in billing for molecular pathology services. The
current CPT and HCPCS codes include all analytic services and processes performed with
the test. This approach has resulted in the following subgroups of CPT codes:
• Genomic Sequencing Procedures
• Multi-Analyte with Algorithmic Analyses (MAAAs)
• Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA codes)
• Tier 1 - Analyte Speciﬁc codes; a single test or procedure corresponds to a single CPT
code
• Tier 2 – Rare disease and low volume molecular pathology services
However, the updates to CPT since 2013 have NOT resulted in the elimination or
reduction of stacking of codes in billing. Rather the billing of multiple CPT codes for a
unique molecular pathology or genetic test has signiﬁcantly increased over the last two
years. Coding issues have been identiﬁed throughout all the molecular pathology coding
subgroups, but these issues of billing multiple CPT codes for a speciﬁc test have been
signiﬁcant in the Tier 2 (81400 - 81408) and Not Otherwise Classiﬁed (81479 and 81599)
codes. Per Title 42 of the United States Code (USC) Section 1320c-5(a)(3), providers are
required by law to “provide economical medical services and then, only where medically
necessary”. In keeping with Title 42 of the USC Section 1320c-5(a)(3), claims
inappropriately billed utilizing stacking or unbundling of services will be rejected or
denied.
Many applications of the molecular pathology procedures are not covered services given
a lack of beneﬁt category (e.g., preventive service or screening for a genetic abnormality
in the absence of a suspicion of disease) and/or failure to meet the reasonable and
necessary threshold for coverage (e.g., based on quality of clinical evidence and strength
of recommendation or when the results would not reasonably be used in the
management of a beneﬁciary). Furthermore, payment of claims in the past (based on
“stacking” codes) or in the future (based on the new code series) is not a statement of
coverage since the service may not have been audited for compliance with program
Article - Billing and Coding: Molecular Pathology and Geneti...
https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/artic...
7 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
requirements and documentation supporting the reasonable and necessary testing for the
beneﬁciary. Certain molecular pathology procedures may be subject to medical review
(medical records requested). The medical records must support the service billed.
Molecular pathology tests for diseases or conditions that manifest severe signs or
symptoms in newborns and in early childhood or that result in early death (e.g., Canavan
disease) are subject to automatic denials since these tests are generally not relevant to a
Medicare beneﬁciary.
The following types of tests are examples of services that are not relevant to a Medicare
beneﬁciary, are not considered a Medicare beneﬁt (statutorily excluded), and therefore will
be denied as Medicare Excluded Tests:
• Tests considered screening in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of disease
that are not speciﬁcally identiﬁed by the law
• Tests performed to determine carrier screening
• Tests performed for screening hereditary cancer syndromes
• Prenatal diagnostic testing
• Tests performed on patients without signs or symptoms to determine risk for
developing a disease or condition
• Tests performed to measure the quality of a process
• Tests without diagnosis speciﬁc indications
• Tests identiﬁed as investigational by available literature and/or the literature supplied
by the developer and are not a part of a clinical trial
Screening services such as pre-symptomatic genetic tests and services used to detect an
undiagnosed disease or disease predisposition are not a Medicare beneﬁt and are not
covered.
In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42, Subchapter B, Part 410,
Section 410.32, the referring/ordering practitioner must have an established relationship
with the patient, and the test results must be used by the ordering/referring practitioner in
the management of the patient’s speciﬁc medical problem.
For ease of reading, the term “gene” in this document will be used to indicate a gene,
region of a gene, and/or variant(s) of a gene.
Coding Guidance
Notice: It is not appropriate to bill Medicare for services that are not covered as if they are
Article - Billing and Coding: Molecular Pathology and Geneti...
https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/artic...
8 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
covered. When billing for non-covered services, use the appropriate modiﬁer.
Code selection is based on the speciﬁc gene(s) that is being analyzed. Codes that
describe tests to assess for the presence of gene variants use common gene variant
names. All of the listed variants would usually be tested; however, these lists are not
exclusive. If additional variants, for the same gene, are also tested in the analysis they are
included in the procedure and are not reported separately.
Full gene sequencing is not reported using codes that assess for the presence of gene
variants unless the CPT code speciﬁcally states full gene sequence in the descriptor.
Tier 1 codes generally describe testing for a speciﬁc gene or Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) locus. Tier 2 molecular pathology procedure codes (81400-81408) are used to
report procedures not listed in the Tier 1 molecular pathology codes (81161,
81200-81383). These codes represent rare diseases and molecular pathology procedures
that are performed in lower volumes than Tier 1 procedures. These codes should rarely, if
ever, be used unless instructed by other coding and billing articles.
If billing utilizing the following Tier 2 codes, additional information will be required to
identify the speciﬁc analyte/gene(s) tested in the narrative of the claim or the claim will be
rejected:
• 81400
• 81401
• 81402
• 81403
• 81404
• 81405
• 81406
• 81407
• 81408
Unlisted Molecular Pathology - CPT Code 81479
Providers are required to use a procedure code that most accurately describes the service
being rendered. If the analyte being tested is not represented by a Tier 1 code or is not
accurately described by a Tier 2 code, the unlisted molecular pathology procedure code
81479 should be reported.
However, when reporting CPT code 81479, the speciﬁc gene being tested must be
Article - Billing and Coding: Molecular Pathology and Geneti...
https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/artic...
9 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
entered in block 80 (Part A for the UBO4 claim), box 19 (Part B for a paper claim) or
electronic equivalent of the claim. Failure to include this information on the claim will
result in Part A claims being returned to the provider and Part B claims being rejected. In
addition, medical records may be requested when 81479 is billed. The medical record
must clearly identify the unique molecular pathology procedure performed, its analytic
validity and clinical utility, and why CPT code 81479 was billed.
When multiple procedure codes are submitted on a claim (unique and/or unlisted), the
documentation supporting each code must be easily identiﬁable. If on review the
contractor cannot link a billed code to the documentation, these services will be denied
based on Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, Section 1833.
Testing for Multiple Genes and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) testing
A panel of genes is a distinct procedural service from a series of individual genes. All
services billed to Medicare must be reasonable and necessary. As such, if a provider or
supplier submits a claim for a panel, then the patient’s medical record must reﬂect that
the panel was reasonable and necessary. Alternatively, if a provider or supplier bills for
individual genes, then the patient’s medical record must reﬂect that each individual gene
is reasonable and necessary.
Genes can be assayed serially or in parallel. Genes assayed on the same date of service
are considered to be assayed in parallel if the result of one assay does not affect the
decision to complete the assay on another gene, and the two genes are being tested for
the same indication.
Genes assayed on the same date of service are considered to be assayed serially when
there is a reﬂexive decision component where the results of the analysis of one or more
genes determines whether the results of additional analyses are reasonable and
necessary.
If the laboratory method is NGS testing, and the laboratory assays two or more genes in a
patient in parallel, then those two or more genes will be considered part of the same
panel, consistent with the NCCI manual Chapter 10, Section F, number 8.
If the laboratory assays genes in serial, then the laboratory must submit claims for genes
individually. The order by the treating clinician must reﬂect whether the treating clinician
is ordering a panel or single genes, and additionally, the patient’s medical record must
reﬂect that the service billed was reasonable and necessary.

10/2/25, 13:11
CMS payment policy does not allow separate payment for multiple methods to test for the
same analyte.
We would not expect that a provider or supplier would routinely bill for more than one
distinct laboratory genetic testing procedural service on a single beneﬁciary on a single
date of service. In the rare circumstance that more than one distinct genetic test is
reasonable and necessary for the same beneﬁciary on the same date of service, the
provider or supplier must attest that each additional service billed is a distinct procedural
service using the 59 modiﬁer.
-59 Modiﬁer; Distinct Procedural Service
This modiﬁer is allowable for radiology services and it may also be used with surgical or
medical codes in appropriate circumstances.
When billing, report the ﬁrst code without a modiﬁer. On subsequent lines, report the code
with the modiﬁer. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to indicate that a
procedure or service was distinct or independent from other non-Evaluation and
Management (E/M) services performed on the same day. Modiﬁer 59 is used to identify
procedures/services, other than E/M services, that are not normally reported together, but
are appropriate under the circumstances. Documentation must support a different
session, different procedure or surgery, different site or organ system, separate incision/
excision, separate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in extensive injuries) not
ordinarily encountered or performed on the same day by the same individual. However,
when another already established modiﬁer is appropriate it should be used rather than
modiﬁer 59. Only if a more descriptive modiﬁer is unavailable, and the use of modiﬁer 59
best explains the circumstances, should modiﬁer 59 be used.
The use of the 59 modiﬁer will be considered an attestation that distinct procedural
services are being performed rather than a panel and may result in the request for
medical records.
Frequent use of the 59 modiﬁer may be subject to medical review.
Genomic Sequencing Proﬁles (GSP)
When a GSP assay includes a gene or genes that are listed in more than one code
descriptor, the code for the most speciﬁc test for the primary disorder sought must be
reported, rather than reporting multiple codes for the same gene(s). Reporting multiple
codes for the same gene will result in claim rejection or denial.

11 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (MAAAs) and Proprietary Laboratory
Analyses (PLA)
A valid PLA code takes precedence over Tier 1 and Tier 2 codes and must be reported if
available. Reporting of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 code in this circumstance or in addition to a PLA
code is incorrect coding and will result in claim rejection or denial.
The results of individual component procedure(s) that are inputs to the MAAAs may be
provided on the associated reporting; however, these assays are not reported separately
using additional codes. Claims reporting such will be rejected or denied.
All MAAAs, including those that do not have a Category I code, may be found in Appendix
O of the CPT Manual. When a speciﬁc MAAA procedure is not listed in Appendix O, the
service must be reported with the unlisted MAAA procedure code 81599. Additionally,
when an analysis is performed that may fall within the descriptor of one of the speciﬁc
MAAA CPT codes, but the proprietary name is not included, the service should be
reported with 81599.
When reporting CPT code 81599, a description of the analysis (totaling less than 80
characters) must be entered in block 80 (Part A for the UBO4 claim), box 19 (Part B for a
paper claim) or electronic equivalent of the claim. Failure to include this information on the
claim will result in Part A claims being returned to the provider and Part B claims being
rejected. In addition, medical records may be requested when 81599 is billed. The medical
record must clearly identify the analysis performed, its analytic validity and clinical utility,
and why CPT code 81599 was billed.
Date of Service (DOS)
As a general rule, the DOS for either a clinical laboratory test or the technical component
of a physician pathology service is the date the specimen was collected. In situations
where a specimen is collected over a period of two calendar days, the DOS is the date the
collection ended. There are some exceptions to the DOS policy. Please refer to the CMS
IOM Publication 100-04, Chapter 16, Section 40.8 for complete information related to the
DOS policy.
Documentation Requirements
1. All documentation must be maintained in the patient's medical record and made
available to the contractor upon request.
2. Every page of the record must be legible and include appropriate patient
Article - Billing and Coding: Molecular Pathology and Geneti...
https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/artic...
12 of 58
10/2/25, 13:11
identiﬁcation information (e.g., complete name, dates of service[s]). The
documentation must include the legible signature of the physician or non-physician
practitioner (NPP) responsible for and providing the care to the patient.
3. The submitted medical record must support the use of the selected ICD-10-CM
code(s). The submitted CPT/HCPCS code must describe the service performed.
4. In accordance with CFR Section 410.32, the medical record must contain
documentation that the testing is expected to inﬂuence treatment of the condition
toward which the testing is directed and will be used in the management of the
beneﬁciary's speciﬁc medical problem.
5. The medical record must support that the referring/ordering practitioner who ordered
the test for a speciﬁc medical problem is treating the beneﬁciary for this speciﬁc
medical problem. An example of documentation that could support the practitioner’s
management of the beneﬁciary’s speciﬁc medical problem would be at least two E/M
visits performed by the ordering/referring practitioner over the previous six months.
6. The medical record must include documentation of how the ordering/referring
practitioner used the test results in the management of the beneﬁciary’s speciﬁc
medical problem.
7. The ordering physician/NPP documentation in the medical record must include, but is
not limited to, history and physical or exam ﬁndings that support the decision making,
problems/diagnoses, relevant data (e.g., lab testing, imaging results).
8. The medical record from the ordering physician/NPP must clearly indicate all tests
that are to be performed.
9. Documentation requirements of the performing laboratory (when requested) include,
but are not limited to, lab accreditation, test requisition, test record/procedures,
reports (preliminary and ﬁnal), and quality control record.

DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVICE: UNDER CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PHYSICIAN MAY NEED TO INDICATE THAT A
PROCEDURE OR SERVICE WAS DISTINCT OR INDEPENDENT FROM
OTHER SERVICES PERFORMED ON THE SAME DAY. MODIFIER -59 IS
USED TO IDENTIFY PROCEDURES/SERVICES THAT ARE NOT
NORMALLY REPORTED TOGETHER, BUT ARE APPROPRIATE UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS MAY REPRESENT A DIFFERENT
SESSION OR PATIENT ENCOUNTER, DIFFERENT PROCEDURE OR
SURGERY, DIFFERNET SITE OR ORGAN SYSTEM, SEPARATE
INCISION/EXCISION, SEPARATE LESION, OR SEPARATE INJURY (OR
AREA OF INJURY IN EXTENSIVE INJURIES) NOT ORDINARILY
ENCOUNTERED OR PERFORMED ON THE SAME DAY BY THE SAME
PHYSICIAN. HOWEVER, WHAN ANOTHER ALREADY ESTABLISHED
MODIFIER IS APPROPRIATE IT SHOULD BE USED RATHER THAN
MODIFIER -59. ONLY IF NO MORE DESCRIPTIVE MODIFIER IS
AVAILABLE, AND THE USE OF MODIFIER -59 BEST EXPLAINS THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOULD MODIFIER -59 BE USED. MODIFIER
CODE 09959 MAY BE USED AS AN ALTERNATE TO MODIFIER -59.
